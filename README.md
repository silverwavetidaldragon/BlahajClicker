# 3. Simon Game Challenge
A simple variant of the classic memory/attention game of Simon Says.

The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
